### Strengths
1. **Efficient Memory Usage**: 1.5 GB model size is excellent for a 3B parameter model
2. **Stable Performance**: Consistent inference times across multiple runs
3. **GPU Compatibility**: Works well with RTX 2060 despite limited VRAM
4. **Multi-precision Support**: Both bfloat16 and float16 configurations work

### Performance Characteristics
1. **Inference Speed**: 3.38 tokens/second is reasonable for the hardware
2. **Memory Efficiency**: Low GPU memory usage leaves room for larger contexts
3. **Quantization Benefits**: 1.58-bit quantization provides significant size reduction

### Areas for Optimization
1. **Inference Speed**: Could be improved with further optimization techniques
2. **Hardware Limitations**: RTX 2060 lacks native bfloat16 support
3. **Context Length**: Current tests used short contexts; longer contexts may impact performance

## Baseline Metrics Summary

| Metric | Value | Unit |
|--------|-------|------|
| Model Size | 1.5 | GB |
| Inference Speed | 3.38 | tokens/second |
